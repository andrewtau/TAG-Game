# TAG-Game
TAG Game created as a final project for my Game Design course
Game is roughly modeled after The Flash.

Rules:

1) You are The Flash, defender of Central City! Run as fast as you can around Central City to avoid being hit by the other speedsters. You can move using WASD or the directional keys on your keyboard.
2) You will slowly build up speed as you keep running. If you stop, your speed will reset and you will have to build up speed again.
3) As you keep running you will also slowly build up Speedforce energy. You can expend this energy by left clicking to unleash a lightning bolt from yourself. Hitting a speedster with a lightning bolt will stun them briefly in the direction they are traveling and allow you time to escape. Note: You need a minimum of 25 Speedforce energy to fire a lightning bolt. Max energy stored is capped at 100. You will also generate more Speedforce energy quicker the faster you run.
4) If your health reaches 0, you will be returned to the Main Menu Screen.


Enemy Speedsters:

1) The Reverse Flash will always be your greatest villain. With that said, he will also be the one that deals the most damage. Avoid him at all cost!
2) The Rival will be the second enemy to spawn in at 1000 points
3) Zoom will be the third enemy to spawn in at 3000 points
4) Godspeed will be the last enemy to spawn in at 6000 points
5) If you survive long enough...you may attract a "bigger fish"

Author Notes: 
1) You may notice that the enemies can phase through buildings but you can't. This is intentional since you already run faster than them. Give them a break!
2) The difficulty will increase the longer you play. This means that the more points you accumulate, the faster the enemy speedsters will become. You will need to out manuever them if you want to survive.
